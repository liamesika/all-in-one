## 🚀 Key Features

### Production-Grade Authentication System
- ✅ Server-side Firebase authentication with secure session management
- ✅ Edge-safe middleware with proper redirect handling (no 500 errors)
- ✅ Database-backed user profiles with `defaultVertical` persistence
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture with `ownerUid` isolation

- ✅ **E-commerce**: Campaign management, lead attribution, auto-followups
- ✅ **Law**: Foundation ready for future implementation
- ✅ **Production**: Specialized vertical for production workflows

### Critical Fixes Implemented

- 🔧 **Unified Vertical Mapping**: Fixed E_COMMERCE ↔ e-commerce enum/slug mismatch
- 🔧 **Server Build**: Enabled middleware execution (removed static export)
- 🔧 **TailwindCSS Stability**: Pinned to v3.4.13, removed v4 compatibility issues
- 🔧 **Component Syntax**: Fixed JSX errors in dashboard layouts
