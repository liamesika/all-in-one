### 3. E2E Test Suite ✅

**File:** `apps/web/e2e/real-estate-leads.spec.ts`

Comprehensive test coverage with **25+ test scenarios**:

#### Desktop Tests (1280×720)
- ✅ Display leads management page with all UI elements
- ✅ Create new lead → verify appears in table
- ✅ Edit lead (name + qualificationStatus) → verify persists
- ✅ Search leads by fullName → verify correct results
- ✅ Filter by status (NEW, CONTACTED, etc.) → verify filtered
- ✅ Filter by source (Website, Facebook, etc.) → verify filtered
- ✅ Export leads to CSV → verify file downloads
- ✅ Import leads from CSV → verify rows added
- ✅ Add note to lead via Edit modal → verify in View modal
- ✅ Delete lead → verify removed from table

#### Mobile Tests (iPhone 12 - 375×667)

**Git Commit:**
- `test(re-leads): Add comprehensive E2E test suite for leads management`

### 4. Firebase REST Authentication ✅

**Files:**
- `apps/web/e2e/utils/firebase-auth.ts` - Firebase REST API helper
- `apps/web/e2e/global-setup.ts` - Playwright global setup

**Features:**
- ✅ Firebase REST API authentication (no browser UI required)
- ✅ Create storage state with auth tokens
- ✅ Save to `e2e/.auth/storage-state.json`
- ✅ Reuse across all test projects (fast, reliable)
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**How It Works:**
1. Global setup runs once before all tests
2. Signs in via Firebase REST API (`signInWithPassword`)
3. Creates Playwright storage state with auth tokens
4. All tests use saved storage state (no re-authentication)
5. Fast, reliable, no UI flakiness

**Git Commit:**
- `test(e2e): Add Firebase REST auth for E2E with global setup and fixtures`

### 5. Test Fixtures ✅

**Files:**
- `apps/web/e2e/fixtures/leads.csv` - Test data for CSV import (7 rows, including invalid)
- `apps/web/e2e/fixtures/leads-export.expected.csv` - Expected CSV format

**Test Data Includes:**
- Valid leads with various sources (Website, Facebook, Instagram, Import, Other)
- Invalid row with bad phone/email (for validation testing)
- Bilingual names (John Doe, David Cohen, Sarah Levi, Rachel Green)

**Git Commit:**
- `test(e2e): Add Firebase REST auth for E2E with global setup and fixtures`

### 6. Playwright Configuration ✅

**File:** `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`

**Configuration:**
- ✅ Global setup for Firebase authentication
- ✅ Desktop project (1280×720) with storage state
- ✅ Mobile project (iPhone 12) with storage state
- ✅ Video recording on failure
- ✅ Base URL: `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ Reuse existing dev server (fast local development)

**Projects:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'chromium-desktop',
  viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
  storageState: STORAGE_STATE_PATH,
}

{
  name: 'chromium-mobile',
  use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
  storageState: STORAGE_STATE_PATH,
}
```

**Git Commits:**
- `test(config): Update Playwright config for port 3001 and add mobile project`
- `test(e2e): Add Firebase REST auth for E2E with global setup and fixtures`

```javascript
config.ignoreWarnings = [
  /Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression/,
  /require-in-the-middle/,
  /@opentelemetry/,
];
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Clean dev logs
- ✅ No functional changes
- ✅ Telemetry still works in production

## Known Issues

### ⚠️ LAW Vertical 500 Errors (Not Blocking)

**Routes Affected:**
- `/dashboard/law/clients`
- `/dashboard/law/tasks`

**Status:** Not fixed (tracked separately)
**Impact:** LAW vertical only (does not affect Real Estate or E-commerce)
**Scope:** Should be fixed in separate PR to avoid scope creep
**Required Action:** Debug LAW routes, add error boundaries, add empty states

**Next Steps:**
1. Check LAW API routes in `apps/web/app/dashboard/law/`
2. Verify Firebase auth working for LAW routes
3. Add error boundaries for graceful fallback
4. Add meaningful empty states
5. Ensure no regressions to other verticals

## How to Run E2E Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Set environment variables** in `apps/web/.env.local`:
   ```bash
   # Already present
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-app.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

   # Add these
   E2E_TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com
   E2E_TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your-test-password
   ```

2. **Create test user in Firebase**:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
   - Add user with email/password
   - Ensure user has access to Real Estate leads in database

3. **Install Playwright browsers** (first time only):
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all Real Estate leads tests (desktop + mobile)
pnpm --filter @apps/web exec playwright test e2e/real-estate-leads.spec.ts

# Run only desktop tests
pnpm --filter @apps/web exec playwright test --project=chromium-desktop

# Run only mobile tests
pnpm --filter @apps/web exec playwright test --project=chromium-mobile
