## ⏸️ PENDING (Nice-to-Haves)

### 1. Image Optimization
- [ ] Lazy-load icons (already using lucide-react, minimal impact)
- [ ] Add next/image for any raster images
- [ ] Define image sizes for responsive loading

### 2. Performance
- [ ] Preload critical fonts (check if needed)
- [ ] Preload hero CSS (check if needed)
- [ ] Consider code splitting for heavy components

### 3. i18n/RTL
- [ ] Marketing pages currently don't use LangProvider
- [ ] Decision needed: Add i18n to marketing pages or keep English-only?
- [ ] If RTL needed: Add useLang hook, wrap content, add dir attribute

### 4. Lighthouse Audit
- [ ] Run Lighthouse on all 4 pages (mobile + desktop)
- [ ] Target: ≥90 across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
- [ ] Document scores
