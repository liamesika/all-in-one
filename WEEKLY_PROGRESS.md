## Week of January 20-26, 2025

### Phase 6: Optimization, Polish & Testing

---

## ‚úÖ Completed This Week

### 1. Design System 2.0 - Full Implementation
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Impact:** Complete visual consistency across all verticals

**What was done:**
- Transformed 15+ pages across Real Estate, E-Commerce, Law, and Productions verticals
- Unified all UI with UniversalCard, UniversalButton, UniversalTable, StatusBadge
- Replaced 100+ custom SVG icons with Lucide React icons
- Implemented full dark mode support (#0E1A2B, #1A2F4B backgrounds)
- Standardized primary color to #2979FF throughout platform

**Pages Transformed:**
- **Real Estate:** Dashboard, Properties, Leads, AI Searcher, Campaigns, Reports
- **E-Commerce:** Dashboard, Leads, Campaigns
- **Law:** Dashboard with full widget structure
- **Productions:** All pages (previously completed)
- **Global:** EffinityHeader navigation component

### 2. React Query Integration
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (Infrastructure)
**Impact:** Better data fetching, caching, and state management

**What was done:**
- Installed @tanstack/react-query + devtools
- Created QueryProvider with optimized defaults:
  - 30-second stale time for fresh data
  - 5-minute cache time for unused data
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Window focus refetching for real-time updates
- Built reusable hooks:
  - `useLeads` - Fetch leads with filters
  - `useCampaigns` - Fetch campaigns
  - Mutation hooks for create/update/delete operations
- Integrated toast notifications with mutations
- Enabled React Query DevTools in development

**Next Step:** Replace all `fetch()` calls in dashboard pages with React Query hooks

---

### 3. Skeleton Loading System
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Impact:** Better perceived performance and reduced layout shift

**What was done:**
- Created `/components/skeletons/` directory
- Built reusable skeleton components:
  - `CardSkeleton` - For card placeholders
  - `KPISkeleton` - For dashboard KPI metrics
  - `TableSkeleton` - For table loading states
  - `DashboardSkeleton` - Full dashboard layout skeleton
- Added dark mode support to all skeletons
- Ready to replace spinner loading states

**Next Step:** Replace all spinner loading with skeleton screens

## üöß In Progress

### Replace fetch() with React Query
**Current:** Starting migration of dashboard pages
**Target:** All API calls use React Query hooks

**Plan:**

## üêõ Issues & Fixes

### Fixed This Week
1. **JSX Closing Tag Mismatch** - Real Estate Leads page had `</div>` instead of `</main>` (fixed)
2. **Build Errors** - All TypeScript errors resolved

### Known Issues
- None currently blocking

## üìù Technical Decisions

### React Query Configuration
**Decision:** Use 30-second stale time for dashboard data
**Rationale:** Balance between freshness and API load. Dashboard data doesn't need instant updates but should feel responsive.

### Skeleton vs Spinner Loading
**Decision:** Replace all spinners with skeletons
**Rationale:** Better UX - users see content-aware placeholders instead of generic spinners. Reduces perceived loading time.

### Dark Mode Color Palette
**Decision:** #0E1A2B (page bg), #1A2F4B (card bg), #2979FF (primary)
**Rationale:** High contrast, modern look, passes WCAG AA standards.
