## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set Up Stripe
1. Create Stripe account
2. Create products and prices
3. Configure webhooks
4. Copy keys to `.env.local`

### 3. Run Database Migration
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev --schema packages/server/db/prisma/schema.prisma --name add-billing-system
```

### 4. Update Existing API Routes
Follow the integration guide in `/apps/web/app/api/billing/example-with-limits/route.ts` to add billing guards to:
- Real estate leads API
- Real estate properties API
- E-commerce leads API
- Automations API
- Integrations API

### 5. Test Locally
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start development server
pnpm dev

# Terminal 3: Test with Stripe CLI
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### 6. Deploy to Production

2. Configure production webhook endpoint in Stripe
3. Test with real payment methods
4. Monitor webhook logs

---

## Integration Example

Here's how to add billing limits to any API route:

```typescript
import { guardResourceCreation, requireActiveSubscription } from '@/lib/billing-guard';
import { trackLeadCreation } from '@/lib/usage-tracker';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const orgId = request.headers.get('x-org-id');

  // 1. Check subscription
  const subCheck = await requireActiveSubscription(orgId);
  if (subCheck) return subCheck;

  // 2. Check limits
  const limitCheck = await guardResourceCreation(orgId, 'leads');
  if (limitCheck) return limitCheck;

  // 3. Create resource
  const lead = await prisma.realEstateLead.create({ ... });

  // 4. Track usage
  await trackLeadCreation(orgId, lead.id);

  return NextResponse.json({ lead });
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on subscription lookups
- Cached usage stats (can be added later)
- Efficient usage tracking (batched if needed)
- Webhook idempotency
- Rate limiting on billing endpoints

---

## Security Features

- Server-side limit enforcement
- Webhook signature verification
- Encrypted Stripe keys
- No client-side limit bypasses
- Proper error messages (no sensitive data)
- API key never exposed to client

---

## Monitoring Recommendations

Track these metrics in production:
1. Subscription conversion rate (trial → paid)
2. Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
3. Customer lifetime value (LTV)
4. Churn rate
5. Average usage per plan
6. Limit reached frequency
7. Upgrade frequency
8. Failed payment rate
9. Webhook success rate
10. API endpoint performance
