### 4. Module Registration ✅
- Both services and controllers registered in `CreativeProductionModule`
- Exported for potential use by other modules
- PrismaModule and UsageTrackingModule dependencies

## Real Estate UI Patterns Analyzed ✅

### Key Patterns Identified:
1. **Layout**: `min-h-screen bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#0E1A2B]` with RTL/LTR support
2. **Tables**: UniversalTable with mobile card fallback
3. **Filters**: Desktop dropdowns + Mobile Drawer (temp state → Apply/Reset)
4. **Bulk Actions**: BulkActionsMenu with selected count + actions array
5. **Badges**: StatusBadge with custom color classes
6. **Empty States**: TableEmptyState (icon, title, description, action CTA)
7. **Modals**: Consistent modal/drawer with focus traps
8. **Navigation**: Left sidebar with context-aware AIAdvisorBot

### Shared Components Available:
- UniversalCard, CardHeader, CardBody
- UniversalButton (variants: primary, outline, ghost, success, danger)
- UniversalTable, TableHeader, TableBody, TableRow, TableHead, TableCell
- StatusBadge, UniversalBadge
- Drawer (mobile filter drawer with Apply/Reset)
- BulkActionsMenu
- TableEmptyState
- UniversalModal

## Next Steps (Frontend)

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Create Creative Productions Navigation Layout**
   - New layout at `/dashboard/production/creative/layout.tsx`
   - Left nav with 10 items (mirror Real Estate structure):
     1. Overview (dashboard cards + recent activity)
     2. Projects (list/table + detail with tabs)
     3. Assets (library + upload flow)
     4. Renders (queue & history)
     5. Tasks (kanban/table with status, assignee, due)
     6. Reviews (approval workflow)
     7. **Customers** ⭐ (NEW - CRM-lite)
     8. **Calendar** ⭐ (NEW - timeline view)
     9. Analytics (usage overview, no billing)
     10. Settings (module prefs, no payments)

2. **Build Customers Page** (`/dashboard/production/creative/customers/page.tsx`)
   - Use Real Estate Leads UI patterns (LeadsClient.tsx as template)
   - List/table with filters (search, tags)
   - Columns: Name, Company, Emails, Phones, Tags, Projects Count, Last Activity
   - Actions: Create, Edit, View detail drawer, Delete
   - Bulk actions: Export, Archive
   - Mobile: Card view with 44px min-height touch targets
   - Desktop: Table with checkboxes + bulk selection
   - Filter drawer for mobile (temp state → Apply/Reset pattern)

3. **Build Calendar Page** (`/dashboard/production/creative/calendar/page.tsx`)
   - Month / Week / Agenda view modes
   - Event types: Project deadlines, Task due dates, Reviews, Render milestones
   - Filters: By project, by event type, by status, by assignee
   - Click event → Drawer with context & quick actions
   - Use Real Estate date picker and filter UI patterns
   - Color-code by event type (match Productions theme)

4. **Update Existing Productions Pages**
   - Overview: Add KPI cards using Real Estate dashboard patterns
   - Projects: Convert to UniversalTable with filters + bulk actions
   - Assets: Add UniversalCard grid with StatusBadge
   - Renders: Add queue visualization with priority indicators
   - All pages: Apply consistent RTL/LTR support, dark mode, mobile-first

5. **Add Feature Flags**
   - `ff.productions_prod_mode` → ON in staging, gated in prod
   - `ff.productions_calendar` → Enable/disable Calendar page
   - `ff.productions_customers` → Enable/disable Customers page
   - Disabled features show tooltip: "Coming soon"

6. **Add GA4 Events**
   - Naming pattern: `prod_*` (e.g., `prod_customer_created`, `prod_project_created`)
   - Track all user actions in Productions vertical
   - Tag with `vertical=productions`, `accountId`, `projectId`
   - Sentry tags: same structure for error tracking

## Security Reminders

**Multi-Tenant Scoping** (CRITICAL):
- Every query filtered by `organizationId` + `ownerUid`
- Ownership verified before updates/deletes
- No cross-tenant data leakage
- S3 URLs: Presigned only (when upload enabled)

**Auth Flow**:
1. Frontend: Firebase Auth JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. Backend: Auth guard extracts `organizationId`, `ownerUid`, `userId`
3. Service layer: All operations scoped to authenticated organization
4. Usage tracking: Automatically logs with user context

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Lighthouse Scores**: ≥90 on all new pages (perf/a11y/best practices)
2. **No Console Errors**: Clean browser console on all pages
3. **Mobile-First**: 44px min-height for touch targets, responsive breakpoints
4. **Dark Mode**: Full support via Tailwind dark: variants
5. **RTL/LTR**: Proper directional layout based on language context
6. **No Billing Logic**: Zero references to Stripe, payments, checkout, pricing

## Commits

1. **Backend APIs + DB Schema**:
   - Commit: `54cf4bb`
   - Message: `feat(productions): Add Customers and Calendar APIs with Real Estate UI alignment`
   - Files: 8 changed, 776 insertions

## Current Status

- ✅ Backend fully implemented and committed
- ✅ Database schema deployed (Prisma db push successful)
- ✅ Real Estate UI patterns documented
- ⏳ Frontend navigation layout (next task)
- ⏳ Customers page (next task)
- ⏳ Calendar page (next task)

## Technical Debt / TODOs

1. **S3 Upload Integration**: `generateUploadUrl()` placeholder in AssetsService
2. **Render Worker**: Queue ready, worker implementation pending
3. **Firebase Storage**: Alternative to S3 (config pending)
4. **JWT Guard**: Replace header-based auth with proper NestJS guard
5. **Feature Flag Service**: Centralized feature flag management
6. **GA4 Wrapper**: Create unified analytics service
7. **Additional Controllers**: Assets, Renders, Tasks, Reviews (services exist)

## Definition of Done (DoD)

For this phase to be considered complete:
- [ ] All 10 Creative Productions pages functional
- [ ] Customers CRUD working (create, list, detail, edit, delete)
- [ ] Calendar showing all event types with filters
- [ ] Navigation matches Real Estate UI/UX exactly
- [ ] No Real Estate data touched (zero coupling)
- [ ] Multi-tenant security verified on all endpoints
- [ ] Lighthouse scores ≥90 on new pages
- [ ] README_PRODUCTIONS_UI.md complete with:
  - Routes table
  - API endpoints table
  - Feature flags list
  - Screenshots (Customers + Calendar)
  - Example API requests/responses

---

**Next Command**: Continue with frontend implementation starting with navigation layout.
