# RBAC Implementation Summary - Phase 5.6

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE

This document summarizes the comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system implemented for the EFFINITY platform.

---

## Overview

A full-featured RBAC system has been implemented with:
- Database schema enhancements
- Permission checking infrastructure
- API middleware for route protection
- Frontend permission gates and hooks
- Admin UI for member management
- Complete permission matrix
- Migration ready for deployment

---

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**File:** `/packages/server/db/prisma/schema.prisma`

**Changes:**
- Added `FeatureAccess` enum with 42 granular permissions
- Enhanced `Membership` model with:
  - `customPermissions` (JSON) for permission overrides
  - `invitedBy` field for audit trails
  - `joinedAt` timestamp
  - New indexes for `role` and `status`
- Added `PlanPermissions` model for plan-based permission configuration
- Added index on `Subscription.plan` for performance

**Migration:** `/packages/server/db/prisma/migrations/20251013153927_add_rbac_permissions_system/migration.sql`
- Creates `FeatureAccess` enum
- Alters `Membership` table with new fields
- Creates `PlanPermissions` table
- Seeds default permissions for all 4 plans
- Adds performance indexes

---

### 2. Configuration Layer

**File:** `/apps/web/config/permissions.ts`

**Contents:**
- `PLAN_PERMISSIONS`: Permission sets for each subscription plan (BASIC, PRO, AGENCY, ENTERPRISE)
- `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`: Permission sets for each role (OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, MEMBER, VIEWER)
- `getPlanPermissions()`: Function to get inherited permissions for a plan
- `FEATURE_GATES`: UI feature flags for plan-gating
- `PLAN_LIMITS`: Resource limits per plan
- `PERMISSION_DESCRIPTIONS`: Human-readable descriptions of each permission
- Helper functions for permission lookups

**Key Features:**
- Permission inheritance (PRO includes BASIC, AGENCY includes PRO, etc.)
- Plan-based feature gating
- Resource limit definitions
- Clear permission descriptions for UI

---

### 3. Permission Checking Library

**File:** `/apps/web/lib/permissions.ts`

**Class:** `PermissionChecker`

**Methods:**
- `checkPermission()`: Check single permission for user/org
- `checkAnyPermission()`: Check if user has ANY of specified permissions
- `checkAllPermissions()`: Check if user has ALL specified permissions
- `getUserPermissions()`: Get all effective permissions for a user
- `getUserRole()`: Get user's role in organization
- `isOwner()`: Check if user is organization owner
- `isAdminOrOwner()`: Check if user is admin or owner
- `getOrgPlan()`: Get organization subscription plan
- `hasActiveSubscription()`: Check subscription status
- `grantCustomPermission()`: Add custom permission to user
- `revokeCustomPermission()`: Remove custom permission from user

**Logic:**
1. Checks membership status (must be ACTIVE)
2. Checks subscription status (must be ACTIVE)
3. Checks plan-level permissions (feature must be in plan)
4. Checks role-level permissions (role must grant feature)
5. Applies custom permission overrides (grants or denials)

**Singleton:** Exported as `permissionChecker` for easy importing

---

### 4. API Middleware

**File:** `/apps/web/middleware/permissions.ts`

**Functions:**

1. `requirePermission(...permissions)`: Middleware to require ALL specified permissions
   - Returns 403 if permission denied
   - Returns null to continue to handler

2. `requireAnyPermission(...permissions)`: Middleware to require ANY of specified permissions

3. `requireRole(...roles)`: Middleware to require specific role(s)

4. `requireOwner()`: Shortcut for owner-only routes

5. `requireAdminOrOwner()`: Shortcut for admin/owner routes

6. `requireActiveSubscription()`: Check subscription status

7. `getAuthContext(request)`: Extract userId and orgId from headers

8. `combineMiddleware()`: Compose multiple middleware checks

9. `withPermissions()`: Wrapper function for easy route protection
   - Checks permissions
   - Extracts auth context
   - Calls handler with context

10. `withRole()`: Wrapper for role-based route protection

**Usage Pattern:**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withPermissions(
    request,
    ['LEADS_READ'],
    async (req, context) => {
      const { userId, orgId } = context;
      // Your logic here
    }
  );
}
```

---

### 5. API Endpoints

#### Permission Check API

**File:** `/apps/web/app/api/permissions/check/route.ts`
- `POST /api/permissions/check`: Check if user has specific permissions
- Body: `{ permissions: FeatureAccess[] }`
- Returns: `{ hasPermission: boolean, permissions: FeatureAccess[] }`

**File:** `/apps/web/app/api/permissions/me/route.ts`
- `GET /api/permissions/me`: Get all permissions for current user
- Returns: `{ permissions: FeatureAccess[], role: MembershipRole, plan: SubscriptionPlan }`

#### Organization Members API (Example Implementation)

**File:** `/apps/web/app/api/organizations/members/route.ts`

Demonstrates complete RBAC integration:
- `GET`: List members (requires `ORG_MEMBERS_READ`)
- `POST`: Invite member (requires `ORG_INVITE_MEMBERS`)
- `PATCH`: Update member (requires `ORG_MEMBERS_WRITE`)
- `DELETE`: Remove member (requires OWNER or ADMIN role)

---

### 6. Frontend Hooks

**File:** `/apps/web/hooks/usePermission.ts`

**Hooks:**

1. `usePermission(permission, requireAll)`: Check if user has permission(s)
   - Returns: `{ hasPermission, isLoading, error }`
   - Automatically fetches from API
   - Handles single or multiple permissions

2. `useUserPermissions()`: Get all user permissions
   - Returns: `{ permissions, role, plan, isLoading, error }`
   - Caches result during session

3. `useRole()`: Get user's role and role checks
   - Returns: `{ role, isOwner, isAdmin, isManager, isMember, isViewer, isLoading }`
   - Convenient boolean flags for each role

4. `usePlanFeature(feature)`: Check if current plan includes feature
   - Returns: `{ hasFeature, currentPlan, isLoading }`

---

### 7. Frontend Components

#### Permission Gates

**File:** `/apps/web/components/permissions/PermissionGate.tsx`

**Components:**

1. `PermissionGate`: Full-featured permission gate
   - Props: `permission`, `children`, `fallback`, `showUpgradePrompt`, `requireAll`, `loadingFallback`
   - Shows upgrade prompt if permission denied
   - Customizable fallback content
   - Loading state support

2. `IfHasPermission`: Simple inline permission check
   - Props: `permission`, `children`
   - No loading state, just hide/show
   - Minimal overhead

3. `PermissionSwitch`: Conditional rendering based on permission

   - Renders different content based on permission

**Usage:**
```tsx
<PermissionGate permission="LEADS_DELETE">
  <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete Lead</button>
</PermissionGate>
```

#### Upgrade Prompts

**File:** `/apps/web/components/billing/UpgradePrompt.tsx`

Enhanced existing component to support:
- Permission-based prompts
- Usage limit prompts
- Required plan display
- Permission descriptions

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Multi-Layer Permission Checks**
   - Membership must be ACTIVE
   - Subscription must be ACTIVE
   - Permission must be in both plan AND role
   - Custom permissions can override

2. **Proper Scoping**
   - All queries must filter by orgId
   - User must be member of organization
   - No cross-organization data leaks

3. **Owner Protection**
   - Owner role cannot be removed
   - Owner cannot remove themselves
   - Only owner can transfer ownership

4. **Backend Enforcement**
   - Permissions ALWAYS checked on API routes
   - Frontend gates are UX-only, not security
   - No trust of client-side data

5. **Audit Trail**
   - `invitedBy` field tracks who invited members
   - `joinedAt` timestamp for membership tracking
   - Custom permissions explicitly logged

### Security Best Practices

1. Always use `withPermissions()` or `requirePermission()` on API routes
2. Never trust headers - always validate against database
3. Log permission denials for security monitoring
4. Regularly audit custom permissions
5. Use role-based guards for administrative functions
6. Keep custom permissions minimal and documented

---

## Common Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Route Protection

```typescript
import { withPermissions } from '@/middleware/permissions';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withPermissions(
    request,
    ['LEADS_READ'],
    async (req, context) => {
      const { orgId } = context;
      // Your logic here
    }
  );
}
```

### Pattern 2: Multiple Permissions

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  return withPermissions(
    request,
    ['CAMPAIGNS_WRITE', 'CAMPAIGNS_MANAGE_BUDGET'],
    async (req, context) => {
      // Requires BOTH permissions
    }
  );
}
```

### Pattern 3: Role-Based Access

```typescript
import { withRole } from '@/middleware/permissions';

export async function DELETE(request: NextRequest) {
  return withRole(
    request,
    ['OWNER', 'ADMIN'],
    async (req, context) => {
      // Only owners and admins
    }
  );
}
```

### Pattern 4: Frontend Permission Gate

```tsx
import { PermissionGate } from '@/components/permissions/PermissionGate';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <PermissionGate permission="LEADS_DELETE" showUpgradePrompt={true}>
      <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>
    </PermissionGate>
  );
}
```

### Pattern 5: Conditional UI with Hook

```tsx
import { usePermission } from '@/hooks/usePermission';

function MyComponent() {
  const { hasPermission } = usePermission('LEADS_EXPORT');

  return (
    <div>
      {hasPermission && <button>Export</button>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Permission Check Returns False

**Possible Causes:**
1. User not member of organization
2. Membership status not ACTIVE
3. Subscription not ACTIVE
4. Permission not in plan
5. Permission not in role
6. Custom permission denial

**Debug Steps:**
```typescript
const permissions = await permissionChecker.getUserPermissions(userId, orgId);
console.log('User permissions:', permissions);

const role = await permissionChecker.getUserRole(userId, orgId);
console.log('User role:', role);

const plan = await permissionChecker.getOrgPlan(orgId);
console.log('Org plan:', plan);
```

### Issue: Frontend Permission Hook Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
1. Missing auth headers (x-user-id, x-org-id)
2. API endpoint not accessible
3. Hook not re-fetching after login

**Solution:**
- Check browser network tab for API calls
- Verify headers are being sent
- Check console for errors

### Issue: Migration Fails

**Possible Causes:**
1. Missing environment variables
2. Database connection issues
3. Conflicting migrations

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check environment
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Reset database (development only!)
./node_modules/.bin/prisma migrate reset

# Re-run migration
./node_modules/.bin/prisma migrate deploy
```
