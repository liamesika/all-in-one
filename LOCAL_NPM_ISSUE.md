# Local npm Installation Issue

## Problem
npm commands are not working in the local environment, even with Node 20 properly installed. This affects local development but **does not affect Vercel deployment**.

## Current Status
- ✅ Node 20 is installed and working: `/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin/node`
- ✅ Vercel configuration is fixed and should deploy successfully
- ❌ npm commands fail locally (both npm and yarn)

## Solutions for Local Development

### Option 1: Reinstall npm manually
```bash
# Download and install npm manually
curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh

# Or try reinstalling Node completely
brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies node
brew cleanup
brew install node@20
brew link node@20
```

### Option 2: Use corepack (recommended)
```bash
# Enable corepack which manages package managers
corepack enable
corepack prepare npm@latest --activate

# Then try installing
npm install
```

### Option 3: Use npx to install packages
```bash
npx --package npm@latest npm install
```

### Option 4: Manual package.json setup
If all else fails, you can create a minimal package-lock.json manually for Vercel.

## For Vercel Deployment (This should work!)

The vercel.json is configured to:
1. Use `npm install --force` (bypasses many issues)
2. Generate Prisma client during build
3. Build the Next.js app properly

**Just redeploy on Vercel with "Clear Build Cache" - it should work!**

## Environment Variables Needed in Vercel
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_DISABLE_SWC_TOOLS_PATCHING=1` (already in vercel.json)

## Why Vercel Will Work
Vercel has a clean Linux environment with proper Node.js and npm installations. Your local macOS environment seems to have npm corruption, but Vercel's servers don't have this issue.
