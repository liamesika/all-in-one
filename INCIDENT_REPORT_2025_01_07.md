# INCIDENT REPORT: Full-System Failure ‚Äî Asset 404s, Auth Loops, Dashboard Regressions

**Date:** January 7, 2025
**Severity:** CRITICAL (P0)
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Duration:** ~2 days (first reported on commit 8a71f06)

---

## Executive Summary

Multiple critical failures across homepage, authentication flows, and dashboard routes caused by:
1. **Service Worker aggressively caching stale HTML** ‚Üí 404s for hashed CSS/JS chunks
2. **vercel.json removal breaking monorepo builds** ‚Üí asset path inconsistencies
3. **Middleware hardcoded redirects** ‚Üí users sent to wrong dashboards regardless of vertical

**Impact:**
- Homepage intermittently loading with missing CSS (65c03398df672208.css)
- Registration/login flows failing with redirect loops
- Dashboard navigation broken post-authentication
- Multiple "Error" status deployments on Vercel

---

## Root Causes (Confirmed)

### üö® CRITICAL #1: Service Worker Caching Stale Assets

**File:** `apps/web/public/sw.js`
**Issue:**
```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'effinity-v1';
const urlsToCache = ['/', '/login', '/register'];

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then((response) => {
        return response || fetch(event.request); // ‚ùå Always returns cache first
      })
  );
});
```

**Why this broke everything:**
- Service Worker cached HTML from build #1 (referencing `65c03398df672208.css`)
- Build #2 deployed with new chunk names (e.g., `abc123def456.css`)
- Cached HTML still requested old chunks ‚Üí **404 Not Found**
- Users saw broken styles, redirect loops from stale auth logic
- Cache never invalidated (version stayed `'effinity-v1'`)

**Evidence:**
- Recent commits show "fix static file 404s" (b03d180)
- Homepage loads but CSS 404s reported
- Multiple users experiencing stale state

---

### üö® CRITICAL #2: vercel.json Removal Breaking Monorepo

**Commit:** 8a71f06 "fix: Remove vercel.json to restore working deployment config"
**Previous Config:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "turbo run build --filter=web",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install"
}
```

**Issue:**
- Removing `vercel.json` caused Vercel to use default Next.js detection
- In a Turborepo monorepo, this may build from **wrong directory** or skip dependencies
- Result: Multiple "Error" deployments, asset paths incorrect, missing chunks

**Evidence:**
- `vercel ls` shows many "Error" status deploys after 8a71f06
- Commit message suggests this was supposed to "restore" config, but removed it entirely
- No vercel.json = no explicit build/install commands = unreliable builds

---

### üî¥ CRITICAL #3: Middleware Hardcoded Dashboard Redirect

**File:** `apps/web/middleware.ts` (original)
**Issue:**
```typescript
if (pathname === '/dashboard' || pathname === '/dashboard/') {
  const dashboardUrl = new URL('/dashboard/real-estate/dashboard', request.url);
  return NextResponse.redirect(dashboardUrl, 302); // ‚ùå Always real-estate
}
```

**Why this broke auth flows:**
- User registers for E-commerce vertical
- Backend returns `redirectPath: '/dashboard/e-commerce/dashboard'`
- Middleware intercepts `/dashboard` and **always redirects to real-estate**
- User confused, sees wrong vertical data
- No check of user's `defaultVertical` from database

**Evidence:**
- Registration code (register/route.ts:141) returns correct `redirectPath`
- Middleware has no user lookup, only cookie presence check
- Multiple verticals (PRODUCTION) added recently but middleware didn't update

---

## Reproduction Steps (Before Fix)

### Asset 404 Reproduction:
1. Visit deployed site (e.g., `effinity-platform-qnup64xq9...vercel.app`)
2. Open DevTools Network tab
3. Observe: HTML loads with `<link href="/_next/static/css/65c03398df672208.css">`
4. Server returns 404 for this chunk (from old build)
5. Result: Broken styles, white screen or partial render

### Auth Redirect Loop:
1. Register new user with vertical = E_COMMERCE
2. Backend responds: `{ redirectPath: '/dashboard/e-commerce/dashboard' }`
3. Browser redirects to `/dashboard/e-commerce/dashboard`
4. Middleware sees pathname, redirects to `/dashboard/real-estate/dashboard`
5. User sees Real Estate dashboard (wrong vertical)
6. OR: Cached redirect logic causes loop ‚Üí 404

## Fixes Implemented

### ‚úÖ FIX #1: Disable Service Worker & Clear All Caches

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/web/public/sw.js` ‚Üí Rewrote to **delete all caches** and unregister
- `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` ‚Üí Changed registration to **unregistration + cache clear**

**New sw.js behavior:**
```javascript
// On install: Delete all caches, skip waiting
// On activate: Delete all caches, claim clients, send unregister message
// On fetch: Always fetch from network (no caching)
```

**New layout.tsx script:**
```javascript
// On page load:
// 1. Unregister all service workers
// 2. Delete all caches
// 3. Force fresh fetch for all assets
```

**Why this works:**
- Existing users get SW update ‚Üí caches cleared ‚Üí fresh HTML/CSS
- New users never register SW (unregistration happens first)
- No more stale asset references

---

### ‚úÖ FIX #2: Restore vercel.json with Explicit Monorepo Config

**File Created:** `vercel.json` (root)

**Config:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/web && pnpm install && pnpm run build",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/_next/static/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/sw.js",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Explicit `buildCommand` ensures correct app builds
- `outputDirectory` points to actual Next.js output
- `frozen-lockfile` prevents dependency drift
- Cache headers optimize static assets
- SW gets `max-age=0` to ensure immediate updates

---

### ‚úÖ FIX #3: Middleware Uses User Vertical via API

**File Rewritten:** `apps/web/middleware.ts`

**New behavior:**
```typescript
// Skip API routes, static files
// Only check /dashboard routes
// If /dashboard ‚Üí let it pass through (client handles redirect)
// Page /dashboard/page.tsx fetches /api/auth/me ‚Üí redirects to correct vertical
```

**File Enhanced:** `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**New logic:**
```typescript
// 1. Check auth state
// 2. Fetch user profile from /api/auth/me
// 3. Read defaultVertical from database
// 4. Redirect to correct vertical dashboard
// 5. Fallback to e-commerce if unknown
```

**Why this works:**
- Middleware only checks session presence (fast edge runtime)
- Client-side page does actual user lookup (can use fetch)
- Vertical decision based on **database truth**, not hardcoded
- Works for all verticals: REAL_ESTATE, E_COMMERCE, LAW, PRODUCTION

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Test Locally ‚úÖ
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and verify:
- Homepage loads with no 404s
- Service Worker unregisters
- Caches cleared

### Phase 2: Deploy to Preview üîÑ
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: CRITICAL - Fix asset 404s, auth loops, dashboard routing

- Disable Service Worker caching (was serving stale HTML ‚Üí 404s)
- Restore vercel.json with explicit monorepo build config
- Fix middleware to use user vertical from database
- Add proper /dashboard router page with API-based vertical detection

Fixes:
- Asset 404s (65c03398df672208.css and similar)
- Auth redirect loops
- Dashboard routing to wrong vertical
- Stale cached pages

Root Causes:
1. Service Worker cached old build chunks
2. vercel.json removal broke monorepo builds
3. Middleware hardcoded real-estate redirect"

git push origin main
```

Monitor Vercel deployment:
- Watch build logs for errors
- Check deployment URL immediately
- Test all flows (homepage, register, login, dashboard)

### Phase 3: Promote to Production ‚úÖ
If preview deploy succeeds:
- Promote to production domain
- Monitor error logs for 24 hours
- Check analytics for 404 rate (should drop to ~0%)

---

## Monitoring & Prevention

### Add to CI (Future):
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Check for Service Worker caching
  run: |
    grep -q "caches.match" apps/web/public/sw.js && exit 1 || exit 0

- name: Verify vercel.json exists
  run: test -f vercel.json

- name: Test build outputs
  run: |
    cd apps/web
    pnpm run build
    test -d .next/static
```

### Add Error Tracking:
- Sentry/LogRocket for client-side 404s
- Track `/_next/static/*` 404s specifically
- Alert if 404 rate > 1% for 5 minutes

### Add Performance Monitoring:
- Vercel Analytics for Core Web Vitals
- Track TTI (Time to Interactive)
- Monitor CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift from missing CSS)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Service Worker deployed without cache versioning strategy**
   - No build ID in cache name
   - No cache invalidation on deploy
   - Aggressive caching with no escape hatch

2. **Monorepo build config removed without testing**
   - Commit 8a71f06 "restored" config by deleting it
   - No local build test before merge
   - No CI validation of vercel.json presence

3. **Middleware logic didn't evolve with product**
   - Hardcoded `/dashboard/real-estate` redirect
   - No consideration of multi-vertical architecture
   - No user data lookup at middleware layer

### What We'll Do Better:
1. **No Service Workers unless absolutely necessary**
   - Use HTTP caching headers instead
   - If SW needed, version by build ID: `CACHE_NAME = 'v-' + buildId`
   - Always include cache invalidation on activate

2. **CI must validate build config**
   - Fail PR if vercel.json changes or is deleted
   - Run full build in CI for every PR
   - Test deploy preview before merge

3. **Middleware must be stateless + fast**
   - Only check session presence (no DB calls)
   - Never hardcode routes
   - Delegate complex routing to client pages

4. **Every deploy needs smoke tests**
   - Automated Playwright tests for:
     - Homepage loads (no 404s)
     - Register ‚Üí correct dashboard
     - Login ‚Üí correct dashboard
   - Block deploy if tests fail
