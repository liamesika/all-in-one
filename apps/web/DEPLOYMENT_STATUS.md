# Customers page
lighthouse https://effinity-platform-3rw4gu7ps-all-inones-projects.vercel.app/dashboard/production/creative/customers \
  --output html \
  --output-path ./lighthouse-customers.html \
  --view

# Calendar page
lighthouse https://effinity-platform-3rw4gu7ps-all-inones-projects.vercel.app/dashboard/production/creative/calendar \
  --output html \

  --view
```

**Target:** All scores ‚â•90 (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)

### GA4 Event Verification

1. Open DevTools Console on pages
2. Perform actions (search, filter, navigate)
3. Look for `[GA4]` log lines showing event tracking
4. Or check GA4 Real-time Reports at https://analytics.google.com

## Next Steps

1. **Run Lighthouse audits** on machine with Chrome installed
2. **Verify GA4 events** in browser console or GA4 dashboard
3. **Add test data** (2-3 sample customers, projects with deadlines)
4. **Configure Sentry** for error tracking
5. **Implement remaining pages** (Projects, Assets, Renders, Tasks, Reviews, Analytics, Settings)
